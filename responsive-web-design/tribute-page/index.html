            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>1815</strong> - Was born in London on December 10, 1825, under the name Augusta Ada Byron.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1828</strong> - Wrote her first book in 1828 when she was only 12 years old. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1833</strong> - Was introduced to Charles Babbage, a man who whould later be considered a founding father of the computer. Babbage showed Ada his so-called Difference Engine, a machine that attempted to perform simple calculations.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1841</strong> - Was tasked with translating a lecture performed by Charles Babbage into English. The lecture was about Babbage's new Analytical Engine, which was based on his previous work on the Difference Engine.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1843</strong> - Finished her work on the translation of Babbage's lecture as well as her detailed notes on the topic, which ended up being much longer and more important than the translation itself. Her notes were categorized from A to G, the most famous of which was called Note G. Nowadays, the Analytical Engine is seen as an early model of a computer while Ada's notes describe for the first time, a computer and its software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>1850</strong> - Came up with a system that was meant to predict gambling odds on horse races. This failed miserably.

                    <strong>1852</strong> - dies at the age of 36.
